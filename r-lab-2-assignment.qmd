# Assignment

* Read the lab
    * Open the r-lab-2.qmd file
    * Click the "Render" button.
    * Read through the lab in your browser (your browser should open a new tab).
* Using the r-lab-2-template.qmd file, create two visualizations using the building blocks at the end of this assignment. Make sure that all axes are labeled and a theme is applied.
	1. Chart showing the average delay by carrier
	1. Chart showing the total number of flights by month and carrier
	
	
Lines of code to use for visualizations:

* ggplot(flights_by_month)
* ggplot(avg_delays) 
* geom_line(aes(x=dt,y=num_flights,color=carrier)) 
* geom_col(aes(y=carrier,x=avg_delay)) 
* labs(x='Average Delay (Minutes)',y='Carrier') 
* labs(x='Departure Date',y='# of Flights',color='Carrier') 
* theme_bw()
* theme_classic()
